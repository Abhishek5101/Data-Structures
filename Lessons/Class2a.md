# Class 2a: Recursion & Search Algorithms

## Topics
- Compare [iteration] and [recursion] with [factorial] function
- Search algorithms: [linear search] and [binary search]

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to...

1. Compare and contrast iterative and recursive implementations of a function
1. Compare and contrast linear and binary search
1. Practice algorithm analysis to find the running time of the algorithm
